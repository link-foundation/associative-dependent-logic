Both implementations are equivalent: they pass the same 93 tests and produce identical results for all inputs.

## Processing Pipeline

The evaluation pipeline has four stages:

```
LiNo text → Parse → AST → Evaluate → Results
```

### Stage 1: LiNo Parsing

**Input:** Raw text in LiNo (Links Notation) format.

**Output:** A list of link strings, where each link is a top-level parenthesized expression.

- **JavaScript:** Uses the official [`@linksplatform/protocols-lino`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@linksplatform/protocols-lino) parser.
- **Rust:** Uses a built-in minimal parser (`parse_lino`) with no external dependencies.

Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments and skipped.

### Stage 2: Tokenization and AST Construction

Each link string goes through two sub-steps:

1. **Tokenize** (`tokenize_one` / `tokenizeOne`): Splits a link string into tokens (parentheses and words). Also strips inline comments (everything after `#`) and balances parentheses after stripping.

2. **Parse** (`parse_one` / `parseOne`): Converts the token list into an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree). The AST is a recursive structure:
   - **Leaf nodes:** Strings (symbols, numbers, operators).
   - **List nodes:** Ordered sequences of child nodes, corresponding to parenthesized groups.

There is no operator precedence; all grouping is explicit via parentheses. For example, `(0.1 + 0.2)` is parsed as a 3-element list `["0.1", "+", "0.2"]`, and `((0.1 + 0.2) = 0.3)` is parsed as `[["0.1", "+", "0.2"], "=", "0.3"]`.

### Stage 3: Evaluation

Each AST node is evaluated recursively by `eval_node` / `evalNode`. The evaluation depends on the node structure:

| Pattern | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `"0.5"` (numeric leaf) | Numeric literal, clamped to logic range | `0.5` |
| `"x"` (symbol leaf) | Symbol prior probability (default: midpoint) | `x` |
| `(head: rhs...)` | Definition form | `(a: a is a)` |
| `((expr) has probability p)` | Probability assignment | `((a = a) has probability 1)` |
| `(range: lo hi)` | Range configuration | `(range: -1 1)` |
| `(valence: N)` | Valence configuration | `(valence: 3)` |
| `(? expr)` | Query — returns evaluated truth value | `(? (a = a))` |
| `(A + B)`, `(A - B)`, `(A * B)`, `(A / B)` | Arithmetic (decimal-precision) | `(0.1 + 0.2)` |
| `(A and B)`, `(A or B)` | Logical conjunction/disjunction | `(a and b)` |
| `(A = B)`, `(A != B)` | Equality/inequality | `(a = b)` |
| `(not X)` | Prefix negation | `(not 0.5)` |
| `(op X Y ...)` | Prefix operator application | `(and X Y Z)` |

### Stage 4: Output

Only query expressions `(? ...)` produce output. Their evaluated truth values are collected and returned as an array of numbers.

## Environment (`Env`)

The environment holds all mutable state during evaluation:

- **`terms`**: Set of declared term names (e.g., `a` from `(a: a is a)`).
- **`assign`**: Map from expression keys to assigned truth values.
- **`symbol_prob`**: Map from symbol names to prior probabilities.
- **`lo`, `hi`**: Truth value range bounds. Default: `[0, 1]`.
- **`valence`**: Number of discrete truth levels. Default: `0` (continuous).
- **`ops`**: Map from operator names to operator implementations.

### Clamping and Quantization

All logical results are **clamped** to the range `[lo, hi]` and optionally **quantized** to the nearest discrete level (if `valence >= 2`).

**Quantization algorithm:**
```
step = (hi - lo) / (valence - 1)
level = round((x - lo) / step)
result = lo + clamp(level, 0, valence-1) * step
```

This maps continuous values to the nearest of N evenly-spaced levels in the range.

## Decimal-Precision Arithmetic

### The Problem

IEEE-754 floating-point arithmetic produces unexpected results for some decimal operations:
```
0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004  (not 0.3)
0.3 - 0.1 = 0.19999999999999998  (not 0.2)
```

### The Solution

All arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) use a **decimal-precision rounding** function that rounds results to 12 significant decimal places. This eliminates floating-point artefacts while preserving meaningful precision:

```
decRound(x) = round(x * 10^12) / 10^12
```

**JavaScript implementation:**
```javascript
const DECIMAL_PRECISION = 12;
function decRound(x) {
  if (!Number.isFinite(x)) return x;
  return +(Math.round(x + 'e' + DECIMAL_PRECISION) + 'e-' + DECIMAL_PRECISION);
}
```

**Rust implementation:**
```rust
const DECIMAL_PRECISION: i32 = 12;
pub fn dec_round(x: f64) -> f64 {
    if !x.is_finite() { return x; }
    let factor = 10f64.powi(DECIMAL_PRECISION);
    (x * factor).round() / factor
}
```

### Arithmetic Context

Arithmetic operators evaluate their operands in an **arithmetic context** where numeric literals are **not** clamped to the logic range. This allows expressions like `(2 + 3)` to correctly compute `5`, even though the logic range is `[0, 1]`. Clamping only occurs when the result is used in a logical context (queries, `and`, `or`, etc.).

### Numeric Equality

The `=` operator uses a three-tier comparison:

1. **Explicit assignment:** If a probability has been explicitly assigned to the expression (e.g., `((a = b) has probability 0.5)`), use that value.
2. **Structural equality:** If the left and right AST subtrees are structurally identical, return `hi` (true).
3. **Numeric comparison:** Evaluate both sides and compare with decimal-precision rounding: `decRound(left) == decRound(right)`.

This ensures that `((0.1 + 0.2) = 0.3)` evaluates to `1` (true).

## Operators

### Default Operators

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `not` | Unary | `hi - (x - lo)` | Negation: mirrors around midpoint |
| `and` | N-ary | `avg` | Conjunction (aggregator-based) |
| `or` | N-ary | `max` | Disjunction (aggregator-based) |
| `=` | Binary | Structural/numeric | Equality |
| `!=` | Binary | `not(=(...))` | Inequality |
| `+` | Binary | `decRound(a + b)` | Addition (decimal-precision) |
| `-` | Binary | `decRound(a - b)` | Subtraction (decimal-precision) |
| `*` | Binary | `decRound(a * b)` | Multiplication (decimal-precision) |
| `/` | Binary | `decRound(a / b)` | Division (decimal-precision, 0 on div-by-zero) |

### Aggregators

The `and` and `or` operators can be configured to use different aggregation functions:

| Name | Formula | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|
| `avg` | `sum(xs) / len(xs)` | Default for `and`; average truth value |
| `min` | `min(xs)` | Kleene AND; pessimistic conjunction |
| `max` | `max(xs)` | Default for `or`; Kleene OR |
| `prod` | `∏ xs` | Probabilistic AND (independent events) |
| `ps` | `1 - ∏(1 - xi)` | Probabilistic sum/OR (independent events) |

Operators are redefinable at runtime via LiNo syntax:
```lino
(and: min)       # Switch AND to use minimum
(!=: not =)      # Define != as composition of not and =
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **No operator precedence:** All grouping is explicit via parentheses. This keeps the parser minimal and unambiguous.

2. **Decimal rounding over arbitrary precision:** Using 12-digit decimal rounding instead of arbitrary-precision decimal libraries. This is sufficient for logic/probability use cases and keeps both implementations dependency-free (Rust has zero external dependencies; JavaScript uses only the LiNo parser).

3. **Arithmetic is unclamped:** Arithmetic results are not restricted to the logic range `[lo, hi]`. Clamping only happens when results enter the logical domain (queries, logical operators). This allows natural arithmetic while preserving logic semantics.

4. **Equivalent dual implementations:** JavaScript and Rust implementations are kept in sync with identical test suites (93 tests each), ensuring behavioral equivalence.

5. **Redefinable operators:** All operators can be redefined at runtime, enabling exploration of different logical semantics within the same framework.

## Testing

Both implementations share 93 identical tests organized in these categories:

- **Tokenization** (4 tests): Simple/nested links, inline comments, paren balancing
- **Parsing** (3 tests): Simple/nested/deeply nested AST construction
- **Environment** (6 tests): Default ops, custom ops, expression probabilities, range/valence config
- **Evaluation** (10 tests): Literals, definitions, redefinitions, operators, queries
- **Quantization** (11 tests): Binary, ternary, 5-level, balanced ranges
- **Logic types** (35+ tests): Unary through continuous, both ranges
- **Liar paradox** (6 tests): Resolution across logic types and ranges
- **Decimal arithmetic** (15 tests): Precision, all four operators, equality comparison, nested expressions, edge cases

Run tests:
```bash
cd js && npm test       # JavaScript
cd rust && cargo test   # Rust
